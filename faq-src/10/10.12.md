10.12 - How do I modify the current browser window?
===================================================

In a default security environment you are very limited in how much
you can modify the current browser window.  You can use
`window.resizeTo` or `window.moveTo` to resize or move a
window respectively, but that is it.  Normally you can only
suggest chrome changes in a `window.open`.
