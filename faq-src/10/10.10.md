10.10 - How do I change the confirm box to say yes/no or default to cancel?
===========================================================================

The buttons on a confirm box cannot be changed, nor can a default
button be specified.

Change the question to a statement so that "OK" is suitable as the
default response.

Example:

  * "Would you like us to charge your credit card?" (wrong)
  * "We will now charge your credit card." (right).
