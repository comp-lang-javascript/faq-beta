What is (function(){ /*...*/ })() ?
===================================

This is an anonymous FunctionExpression that is called 
immediately after creation. 

Variables declared inside a function are not accessible from 
outside the function. This can be useful, for example, to hide 
implementation details or to avoid polluting the global scope.
